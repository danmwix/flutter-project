📖 Project Description
The SDG4 Education App is a mobile-first solution to promote digital learning by offering:

A secure and accessible environment for teachers and students

Real-time interaction and learning content sharing

Structured course management and engagement tracking

💡 Limitation and Workaround:
While Firebase provided an excellent backend service, one limitation experienced was the cost of Firebase Storage, which is required to enable file uploads. To keep the app accessible and free, a text-based approach was adopted.
Teachers can paste notes, quizzes, and assignments directly into the app — avoiding the need for storage-based file uploads.
